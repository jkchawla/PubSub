# PUB/SUB
This application is an implementation of pubsub architecture to publish and subsribe to topics. One can add n numbers of publishers and subscribers to get notifcations and unsubsribe them too 

## Problem Statement
Publish/Subscribe (or pub/sub for short) is a popular indirect
communication system. Pub/sub systems disseminates events to multiple recipients (called
subscribers) through an intermediary. Examples of successful pub/sub include Twitter and
“Bloomberg terminal”-like financial systems. In this project, we will emulate a pub/sub system
using the lite weight virtualization or container technology in Docker technology.
